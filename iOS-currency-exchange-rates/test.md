# MyDrive Solutions Challenge for iOS

MyDrive Solutions sales employees travel very often, and they will need an
application to assist them with the currency exchange rate for each country they
visit. The task is to create an iOS application to assist them with currency conversions.

## Requirements / Results

* The app should get the latest exchange rates from this endpoint: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mydrive/code-tests/master/iOS-currency-exchange-rates/rates.json
* The user should be able to select which currency to convert from and to.
* Both 'from' and 'to' selectors should contain ALL currencies (there's enough information to convert from any to all).
* The app should calculate the exchange rate after the user has selected the "from" and "to" currencies.
* Write the unit tests wherever you see fit
* Code should be uploaded to an online code repository that MyDrive staff can be given access to. e.g. Github, bitbucket or equivalent.
* Evaluate your solution, list its strengths and weaknesses. 
* Use as much time you need to create this app. The recommended time is 3 hours
* Please let us know how long this task took you.

## Bonus / Nice to have

* Document the development process for this app (Decisions, libraries, etc).
* Demonstrate good practices in source code management.
* Offline capabilities.
